A visit to Apsarakonda - Gokarna

Going by :
	After a yearful of surprises, me with my gang planned an adventure. The place where Apsara's visited, the hills which streamed out into waterfalls, the place where the beach begins.. Apsarakonda it was.
	Apsarakonda is a small village that is tucked in one corner near the coastal town Honnavar. This beautiful village always receives you with a pleasant climate, a lot of greenery, clear sky, and serene surroundings. As you step into Apsarakonda, you will get a feel as if you have entered a no manâ€™s land. Indeed, calling Apsarakonda a paradise would be an understatement. This blog throws light on Apsarakonda Falls Trek and the beach.
	As it was on new year's eve, we planned Gokarna as the spot; only latter we explored this place and that's were the journey thrilled us.
A blissful morning beneath the hills, as the Apsarakonda waterfalls stood tall before us, started the trip with this refreshing spot and the story continues..

Beach person :
	Everytime I found a beach I met with an artist in me, this time it was Ganapathy.
	This quaint little town gets equal attention for its many calm and clean beaches; tourists from across the country, as well as foreigners, are drawn to the beauty of the town. A quiet beach nearby Apsarakonda waterfalls was the Kasarkod Beach, thus added this wonderfu place to my unexpected-yet-thrilling lists.

Gokarna Trek :
	Found some rest in some nest, and next morning began with hill-top trek.Places to explore :
Pandavas Cave - Huge and attractive caves near the falls called Pandava caves. As per the legends, Pandavas of Mahabharata stayed in these caves during their exile period. Do not enter the caves as there are poisonous snakes inhabiting inside it.
If possible try carrying your own food, as you will not find any eateries other than a small canteen that serves local food.
